In order to get the best results for IGT please fix the issue with your swap partition

--> type the following commands : 

1) sudo swapoff /dev/sda3 (this command will umount the swap partition)
	
2) sudo mkswap /dev/sda3 (this command will return a new UUID that you need to replace for the old in /etc/fstab)

	2.1) # nano /etc/fstab

		and replace the line below of this for the UUID get in the previous step: # swap was on /dev/sda3 during installation
		UUID=<your_new_UUID>

3) sudo swapon /dev/sda3 (this command will mount the swap againg)

4) sudo update-initramfs -k `(uname -r)` -u
