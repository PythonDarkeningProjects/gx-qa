Download ClewareControl (version 2.8) from : 

https://www.vanheusden.com/clewarecontrol/files/clewarecontrol-2.8.tgz

Cleware provides library/tool/executable to control USB and power-cutters

Extract the file on the Raspberry

$ tar -xf clewarecontrol-2.8.tgz
$ cd clewarecontrol-2.8
$ make && sudo make install


Connect the USB-cutter to the raspberry and do the following

USB-cutter
  This is a device which is at its heart a switch like the other switches.
  To use it, you need to start it:
	clewarecontrol -ag
  then, you can toggle the USB status like this:
	clewarecontrol -as 0 1      this will "cut" the USB device (switching
	                            it off)
	clewarecontrol -as 0 0      this will enable the USB device again(!)
  indeed, the logic is inverted.


edit sudoers file and add the following lines (in order to run power_control.sh script)

pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
pi ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/clewarecontrol


clone clewarecontrol scripts from : 
git clone https://github.intel.com/linuxgraphics/gfx-qa-tools.git /home/pi

add this alias to bashrc

alias pcutter_on='bash /home/pi/dev/clewarecontrol/power_control.sh -on'
alias pcutter_off='bash /home/pi/dev/clewarecontrol/power_control.sh -off'

and that's it
