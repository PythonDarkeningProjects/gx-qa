# TESTCASENAME -- the executable test case name to run                                   
# TESTCASEPARAMLIST -- the arguments to be passed to executable test case.               
# SCENARIONAME -- define which scenario this test case belongs to.                       
#    Scenario is the collection of one or several test cases.                            
#    If several scenarios involved this test case, then all related scenario should be   
#    listed here; each of them is split by space.                                        
#    Usually ABAT and SEMI-AUTO scenarios is reserved.                                   
#    ABAT -- "automated basic acceptance test". Tester can select a few basic automatic  
#            test cases from test suite as ABAT. It can make a very fast quality         
#            evaluation for product build.                                               
#    SEMI-AUTO -- "semi-automatic test case". This kind of test case needs tester's      
#                  interaction during executing.                                         
# TIMEOUT -- timeout duration in seconds.                                                
#          STF allows to run executable test case with a timeout limit.                  
#          If this field is omitted, STF will use default value 5.                       
#          Tester can modify environment "DefaultTimeOut" to change the default value.   
# TESTCASEDESCRIPTION -- a brief account of the test case                                
#                                                                                        
# each line can degrade to a simple test case name if no arguments needed, using default 
# timeout, no scenario defined for this test case...
